This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.



# Project Steps
## 1. Set Up the Environment
* Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
* Goal: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

## 2. Set Up Kaggle API
* API Setup: Obtain your Kaggle API token from Kaggle by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
* Configure Kaggle:
   - Place the downloaded kaggle.json file in your local .kaggle folder.
   - Use the command kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path> to pull datasets directly into your project.
## Download Walmart sales data
* Data Source: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
* Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets
